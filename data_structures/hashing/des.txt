#hashing : this is technique used for searching,inserting,deleting elements from a collection using hash table

types of searching
#Linear searching
#Binary searching
#Binary search tree
#hashing

# In hashing we use hash table is used to store data elements
# hash function maps elements to corresponding indices

types of hashing
1)ideal hashing : one to one hashing h(x)=x
2)compression hashing : h(x)= x%10

collison:when more than one key maps to the same index in the hash table with compression hashing

#To avoid collison we techniques
1)chaining
2)Open Addressing
   a)Linear Probing
   b)Quadratic Probing
   c)Double hashing
