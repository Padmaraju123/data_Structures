/*Given inorder and level-order traversals of a Binary Tree,
 construct the Binary Tree. Following is an example to illustrate the problem.

 Input: Two arrays that represent Inorder
       and level order traversals of a 
       Binary Tree
in[]    = {4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 22};
level[] = {20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14};

Output: Construct the tree represented 
        by the two arrays.
        For the above two arrays, the 
        constructed tree is shown in 
        the diagram on right side */
